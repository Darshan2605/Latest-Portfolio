### Explanation:
- **Section Tag**: The `<section>` tag is used to define the certifications section. The `id` attribute allows for easy navigation, and the `class` attribute can be used for styling.
- **Container**: A `<div class="container">` is used to wrap the content, which can help with layout and styling.
- **Heading**: An `<h2>` tag is used for the section title.
- **List of Certifications**: An unordered list (`<ul>`) contains list items (`<li>`) for each certification, including the name, issuing organization, and date.

### Styling:
You may want to add some CSS to your `style.css` file to style this new section according to your portfolio's design. For example:

```css
.certifications {
  padding: 50px 0;
  background-color: #f9f9f9; /* Example background color */
}

.certifications h2 {
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 30px;
}

.certifications ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  padding: 0;
}

.certifications li {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.certifications h3 {
  margin: 0;
  font-weight: 500;
}

.certifications p {
  margin: 5px 0 0;
  color: #666; /* Example text color */
}
```

Make sure to adjust the content and styles as needed to fit your portfolio's overall design and theme.
